# Hit Testing

How the simulator determines which frame is under the mouse cursor.

## Overview

Hit testing runs on every mouse event (move, click, scroll). It takes a screen-space point and returns the ID of the deepest mouse-enabled frame under that point, or `None`.

## Hittable Frame Collection

During the quad batch build (`render.rs` → `build_quad_batch`), the system collects all frames eligible for hit testing as a side output of `collect_sorted_frames()` in `frame_collect.rs`.

A frame is **hittable** when all four conditions are met:

1. `frame.visible == true`
2. `frame.effective_alpha > 0` — ancestor chain is visible (a frame with `visible=true` under a hidden parent has `effective_alpha=0` and is excluded)
3. `frame.mouse_enabled == true` (set via `EnableMouse(true)` in Lua or `enableMouse="true"` in XML)
4. Not in `HIT_TEST_EXCLUDED` — a hardcoded list of full-screen non-interactive overlays: `UIParent`, `WorldFrame`, `Minimap`, `ChatFrame1`, `EventToastManagerFrame`, `EditModeManagerFrame`

The hittable list is sorted by `(frame_strata, frame_level, raise_order, id)` — lowest first. `raise_order` only breaks ties between siblings at the same raw frame level; explicit `Raise()`/`Lower()` cannot cross raw levels. Iterating in **reverse** yields the topmost frame. The render bucket's active top-level show-order grouping is separate from this hit-test list, which is collected by `src/iced_app/frame_collect.rs`.

## Spatial Grid

The sorted hittable list is fed into a `HitGrid` (64px cell spatial index) stored in `App::cached_hittable`. The grid divides screen space into cells and records which frames overlap each cell, preserving strata/level order within each cell. It also stores a `HashMap<u64, Rectangle>` for O(1) rect lookups by frame ID.

The grid is rebuilt on every quad batch rebuild and **not** cleared on layout invalidation to avoid losing hover state between frames.

### Grid Construction

`build_hittable_rects()` converts raw `LayoutRect` values to screen-space `iced::Rectangle` by:

1. Applying **hit rect insets** — shrinking the rect inward by the frame's `(left, right, top, bottom)` insets
2. Scaling by `UI_SCALE`

`HitGrid::new()` then indexes each frame into every cell its rectangle overlaps.

## Hit Test Algorithm

`hit_test(pos)` in `view.rs` runs two phases:

### Phase 1: Find topmost frame (grid lookup)

Computes which cell contains `pos`, then iterates that cell's frames in **reverse** (highest strata/level first). Returns the first frame whose rectangle contains the point. This is O(1) cell lookup + O(k) scan where k is the number of frames in that cell (typically 10–30).

### Phase 2: Drill down to deepest child

Starting from the initial hit, walks down the widget tree through `frame.children`. For each child (checked in reverse order), if the child is in the hittable set (`grid.contains(cid, pos)`) and its rect contains the point, it becomes the new current frame. Repeats until no hittable child contains the point.

This produces the **deepest mouse-enabled descendant**, matching WoW's behavior where child frames receive clicks over parents regardless of frame level.

## Hit Rect Insets

`SetHitRectInsets(left, right, top, bottom)` shrinks a frame's clickable area relative to its visual bounds. Positive values move the edge inward:

```
Visual bounds:  (x, y, width, height)
Hit bounds:     (x+left, y+top, width-left-right, height-top-bottom)
```

Width and height are clamped to zero if insets exceed the frame dimensions.

Insets are stored on the `Frame` struct as `hit_rect_insets: (f32, f32, f32, f32)` and applied during hittable rect cache construction, not during the hit test itself.

### API

- `frame:SetHitRectInsets(left, right, top, bottom)` — set insets
- `frame:GetHitRectInsets()` — returns `left, right, top, bottom`
- XML: `<HitRectInsets left="10" right="10" top="5" bottom="5"/>` — calls `SetHitRectInsets` during frame creation

### Example

A 200x100 frame with `SetHitRectInsets(10, 20, 5, 15)` has an effective clickable area of 170x80, offset 10px from the left and 5px from the top.

## Mouse Event Flow

1. **Mouse move** → `hit_test(pos)` → update `hovered_frame` → fire `OnLeave`/`OnEnter`
2. **Mouse down** → `hit_test(pos)` → fire `OnMouseDown` → track for click/drag
3. **Mouse up** → `hit_test(pos)` → if same frame as mouse down, fire `OnClick` + `PostClick`; otherwise fire `OnMouseUp`
4. **Scroll** → `hit_test(pos)` → walk parent chain for `OnMouseWheel` handler
5. **Middle click** → `hit_test(pos)` → open inspector panel (simulator-only)

Drag detection uses a 5px threshold from the mouse-down position before firing `OnDragStart`.
