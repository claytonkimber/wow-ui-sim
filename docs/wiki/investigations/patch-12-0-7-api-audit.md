# Patch 12.0.7 API Audit

Patch 12.0.7 API work in wow-ui-sim separates safe additive compatibility bridges from security, taint, and secret-value behavior that must be proven with live Blizzard observations before implementation.

## Content

### Source scope

The audit source was the Warcraft Wiki Patch 12.0.7 API changes page, preserved as the checked-in [12.0.7 API-change source snapshot](../../../data/patch-api/sources/12.0.7-api-changes.txt). The page covers the 12.0.5 `(67602)` to 12.0.7 `(68182)` API diff and 12.0.7 blue-post notes.

The machine register is `data/patch-api/12.0.7.json`, sourced from the categorized `data/patch-api/sources/12.0.7-register.json`; [[patch-12-0-7-occurrence-inventory]] is its human-readable inventory. It preserves 131 named occurrences—79 added, 29 changed, and 23 removed. Current occurrence-level classification is **29 implemented, 101 best-effort, 1 repository-scope-authorized impossible exception-requested, and 0 untriaged**. The crawler's unnamed CVar claims remain explicit source metadata rather than invented symbols.

### Completed compatible bridge work

The simulator now provides modeled 12.0.7 social/party mutations:

- `C_BattleNet.InviteFriend` appends a queryable offline Battle.net friend to `SimState.bnet_friends`, ignores empty/duplicate invites, and is visible through `GetNumFriends`/`GetFriendAccountInfo`.
- `C_PartyInfo.DoReadyCheck` / `ReadyCheck` start a ready-check state, dispatch `READY_CHECK`, and expose `GetReadyCheckStatus("player") == "waiting"` with positive `GetReadyCheckTimeLeft()`.
- `C_PartyInfo.ConfirmReadyCheck(ready)` records ready/not-ready state, dispatches `READY_CHECK_CONFIRM` and `READY_CHECK_FINISHED`, and clears the time-left value.
- `C_PartyInfo.IsGUIDInGroup(guid)` now reads the existing simulator party roster and synthetic `UnitGUID("partyN")` values instead of always returning false.
- `C_PartyInfo.SetEveryoneIsAssistant`, `PromoteToAssistant`, `DemoteAssistant`, and `PromoteToLeader` now mutate existing party assistant/leader state used by `IsEveryoneAssistant`, `IsGroupLeader`, and `UnitIsGroupLeader`.

The simulator also provides safe 12.0.7 additive probes for API names that can be inert without pretending to model live game state:
- `C_DelvesUI.GetDelveEntranceTitleString` (now Rust-backed by the Delves UI surface; it shares the seeded entrance header text)
- `C_DurationUtil.CreateManualClock` (now installed by the Rust `C_DurationUtil` surface alongside duration objects)
- `C_DurationUtil.CreateDurationTextBinding` (now best-effort tracks documented binding methods, enabled/default state, duration objects, formatter/text-format storage, and font-string update hooks)
- `C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventColor` (now Rust-backed best-effort delegated to `C_EncounterEvents` color state)
- `C_HousingCatalog.GetCatalogCategoryAndSubcategoryNames` (now Rust-backed deterministic nil until a catalog model exists)
- `C_HousingCustomizeMode.RoomConnectionSupportsDoorType` (now Rust-backed deterministic false until room-door compatibility data exists)
- `C_HousingLayout.CanSetViewedFloor` (now Rust-backed deterministic false until viewed-floor permissions are modeled)
- `C_MerchantFrame.GetMerchantCurrencies` (now Rust-backed deterministic empty table until merchant currency state exists)
- `C_PartyInfo.ConfirmReadyCheck`, `DoReadyCheck`, `UninviteUnit` (now Rust-backed; `UninviteUnit` mutates the existing party roster by unit token/name)
- `C_PingSecure.ClearPendingPingOffScreenCallback` (now Rust-backed through the shared PingSecure callback table)
- `C_QuestHub.GetDragonridingRacesForAreaPOI` (now Rust-backed deterministic empty table until area-POI race content exists)
- `C_UIFileAsset.GetFileID`, `IsKnownFile`, `IsLooseFile` (now best-effort modeled from the bundled limited listfile)
- `GetEventCPUUsage`, `GetFunctionCPUUsage`, `GetScriptCPUUsage` (now provided by the shared performance-metric defaults module)
- secure pending callback getters/setters: button, ping off-screen, toggle run (now Rust-backed through the shared PingSecure callback table; callback storage only, not real secure-execution enforcement)
- `GameTooltip_AddMoneyLine` (now provided by the shared formatting defaults; best-effort formats copper through the simulator money formatter before adding the tooltip line)
- `ENCOUNTER_TIMELINE_EVENT_COLOR_CHANGED` registration under `retail-12-0-7`

Already-existing coverage from prior work included `C_Container.CalculateTotalNumberOfFreeBagSlots`, `C_DelvesUI.GetWorldTierDifficultyForActivePlayer`, `C_PingSecure.SetPendingPingOffScreenCallback`, and `URL_TEXTURE_REQUEST_RESULT` registration.

### CVar changes

The simulator now profile-gates the recovered exact 12.0.7.68235 CVar delta in `src/cvars.rs`: 17 additions, five removals, and the `gxWindowedResolution` default change from `1920x1080` to `auto`. `patch_12_0_7_cvar_defaults_match_retail` verifies all recovered defaults/removals under `retail-12-0-7`.

**Source provenance gap — untriaged, not approved:** the crawler excerpt claimed 20 additions and five removals while naming only six additions and no removals. A separate recovered historical diff identifies 17 additions, five removals, and the default change above; comparing the two leaves three addition claims unsupported. The 131-row source register therefore contains only the six CVar occurrences named by its checked-in crawler source, while all fourteen unnamed addition claims and five unnamed removal claims remain source metadata. Do not invent occurrence IDs; no exception approval is requested or recorded.

### Itemized status matrix

**Current occurrence classification:** the 35 added global APIs and named CVar rows are covered by profile-gated bridge/default tests; clock methods are directly state-tested; duration object/text methods, service-backed globals, changed events/widgets, and retained removals are documented best-effort where exact Blizzard fidelity is not proven. The eight `DurationTextFormattingOptions`/`DurationTextRawValue` rows remain best-effort stale-extraction compatibility entries because their factories return nil; this is documented behavior, not an exception request.

#### Pending classification and exception candidates

The occurrence-level checklist has no untriaged rows. One impossible exception-requested row is authorized by repository scope: `ModelSceneActorBase.GetModelUnitGUID` remains absent because the permanent project 2D/no-3D rule in `AGENTS.md#intentional-gaps` excludes the required 3D model subsystem. This is existing project-scope authority, not a newly granted user exception. Remaining payload, secrecy, and load-order limitations retain explicit best-effort notes rather than hidden claims of native fidelity.

1. **Strict API removals:** exact 12.0.7 startup proof finds 11 names absent: `BNInviteFriend`, `ConfirmReadyCheck`, `DemoteAssistant`, `DoReadyCheck`, `GetMerchantCurrencies`, `IsGUIDInGroup`, `PromoteToAssistant`, `PromoteToLeader`, `SetEveryoneIsAssistant`, `GetAutoCompletePresenceID`, and `IsRecognizedName`. Six compatibility functions remain: `C_ClickBindings.GetStringFromModifiers`, `C_ClickBindings.MakeModifiers`, `C_Spell.GetMawPowerBorderAtlasBySpellID`, `UninviteUnit`, `GetAutoCompleteResults`, and `GetAutoCompleteRealms`. This is best-effort availability evidence; retained wrappers still need source/lifecycle review before strict hiding.
2. **Minimap method removals:** `SetBlipTexture`, `SetCorpsePOIArrowTexture`, `SetIconTexture`, `SetPOIArrowTexture`, `SetPlayerTexture`, `SetStaticPOIArrowTexture`. The simulator retains these methods as compatibility behavior; focused widget-surface coverage records the retained availability as best-effort.
3. **Secret/aspect widget changes:** focused 12.0.7 proof verifies the four Button methods, four ScrollFrame methods, five `SetFont` methods, and all six proposed removed Minimap texture setters remain callable compatibility functions. Exact secret/aspect/asset semantics remain best-effort. `ModelSceneActorBase:GetModelUnitGUID` remains absent under the repository-validated permanent no-3D scope; its impossible exception is scope-authorized rather than exposed as a guessed method.
4. **Restricted unit-token nil/default matrix:** 12.0.7 changed `UnitGUID`, `UnitAura`, health/power, and related PvP-restricted token errors. Need exact token, caller-taint, and return-shape probes.
5. **Encounter behavior:** `ENCOUNTER_END.encounterUnitStatus` payload; `ENCOUNTER_TIMELINE_EVENT_COLOR_CHANGED` firing; five-second warning/custom color semantics. Registration and color reads are present, but payload/firing behavior needs live encounter state.
6. **Secure/taint behavior:** `SimulateMouse` focus/combat/protected restrictions; `debugstack`/`debuglocals` secret propagation; secure `raidtarget set-unmarked` and `/tm ~marker`; `SetFrameStrata` secret-value error change.
7. **Mythic+/group/aura behavior:** `C_MythicPlus` `CalendarTime` result structs; solo follower-dungeon/delve `GROUP_FORMED`; `AuraData.isFromPlayerOrPlayerPet` vehicle ownership; `C_UnitAuras.AddPrivateAuraAppliedSound` active-M+ gate; `AuraFilters` removal of `IMPORTANT`.
8. **Event payload/security changes:** secret-chat-lockdown behavior for the nine changed `CHAT_MSG_*` events; `ClubMemberOpaqueId` second argument for `CLUB_MEMBER_ADDED`, `CLUB_MEMBER_PRESENCE_UPDATED`, `CLUB_MEMBER_REMOVED`, `CLUB_MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATED`, and `CLUB_MEMBER_UPDATED`.
9. **Duration fidelity:** exact `DurationTextBinding` formatter/component/secret semantics. Current object is documented **best-effort**, not a native-fidelity claim.
10. **Source conflicts:** three unnamed CVar additions claimed by the local snapshot; stale `DurationTextFormattingOptions`/`DurationTextRawValue` entries. The latter names only materialize as universal-fallback no-op functions returning nil, not documented factories. Need a corrected authoritative export before implementation.
11. **Probe reconciliation:** `EditModeLayoutProbe` has no captured/reconciled result in the audit. Need a probe result before classifying its layout behavior.

### Best-effort modeled guesses needing later probes

- **C_UIFileAsset path semantics** — `GetFileID` and `IsKnownFile` are backed by `data/wow-ui-sim-listfile.csv` through `limited_listfile`, with slash/case normalization and numeric IDs passed through. `IsLooseFile` currently returns false because loose-file install/source semantics are not modeled. Replace this with exact client behavior if PTR probes show different extension handling or loose-file rules.
- **Encounter timeline color state** — `C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventColor` is Rust-backed and mirrors the existing `C_EncounterEvents` color table, including alpha, then falls back to white when no event color is configured. Exact five-second-warning/custom-color behavior and event firing still need probes.
- **DurationTextBinding formatting** — the 12.0.7 patch bootstrap supplies a documented best-effort binding object for non-secret state, duration-object storage, formatter/text-format storage, and font-string update hooks. Exact Blizzard formatting/component semantics and secret-value handling still need live probes.
- **Tooltip money line formatting** — `GameTooltip_AddMoneyLine` uses the existing `GetMoneyString` fallback with thousands grouping and optional prefix text. Exact embedded-atlas/MoneyFormatter output remains a later fidelity improvement if addon screenshots require it.
- **Party GUID membership** — `C_PartyInfo.IsGUIDInGroup` treats the local player and synthetic party member GUIDs as in-group only while `SimState.party_group_active` is true. Exact instance-party category filtering and cross-realm GUID details remain future fidelity work if addons depend on them.
- **Party role mutators** — `C_PartyInfo` leader/assistant mutators write the existing simulator group-role fields. Individual assistant tracking is not modeled yet, so `PromoteToAssistant` and `DemoteAssistant` map to the coarse `everyone_assistant` flag until a per-member assistant model is needed.

### Paused / blocked items

Security/error-shape-sensitive items still need live Blizzard behavior, generated docs, or targeted probe addons:

- **Unit identity restricted-token behavior** — 12.0.7 changed restricted unit APIs such as `UnitGUID`, `UnitAura`, and health/power APIs from Lua errors to nil/default returns for unsupported PvP-restricted tokens. Need exact token matrix, return values, and addon-vs-Blizzard behavior.
- **Encounter payloads** — `ENCOUNTER_END` now includes `encounterUnitStatus` tables with `creatureID`, `creatureName`, and `remainingHealthPercent`. Need real event payload shape and simulator encounter state backing before modeling.
- **Encounter Events color event semantics** — `C_EncounterEvents` color state and timeline color reads are best-effort bridged, but exact five-second-warning custom-color behavior, persistence rules, and `ENCOUNTER_TIMELINE_EVENT_COLOR_CHANGED` firing need live behavior.
- **SimulateMouse taint and focus restrictions** — 12.0.7 changed taint propagation and imposed forbidden/locked/script-inaccessible/protected focus restrictions. This overlaps secure input and combat lockdown; implement only after exact behavior is known.
- **debugstack/debuglocals secret propagation** — returning secret values based on current/caller stack secret access requires rilua secret-value semantics, not a simple Lua stub.
- **Secure `raidtarget` `set-unmarked` and `/tm ~N` behavior** — secure action and macro execution behavior needs real secure-state tests.
- **C_MythicPlus CalendarTime return structs** — `GetRunHistory`, `GetWeeklyBestForMap`, and `GetSeasonBestForMap` changed return struct shape. Need backing M+ data and exact CalendarTime fields.
- **GROUP_FORMED solo follower dungeon/delve behavior** — needs group/follower-dungeon state, not just a registerable event.
- **AuraData vehicle ownership and AddPrivateAuraAppliedSound allowance** — aura state/security behavior needs real aura model and M+ combat state.
- **SetFrameStrata secret-value error fix** — secret argument behavior needs live tests before changing method guards.
- **Button/scroll secret aspects and font asset validation** — focused 12.0.7 proof verifies current method availability, but exact secret aspect and asset-validation semantics remain best-effort and need probes.
- **Removed Minimap texture setters** — simulator method availability must be checked against active Blizzard sources before hiding anything; removing too early could break cached UI code.
- **Deprecated wrappers / removed globals** — exact 12.0.7 startup proof now records the per-name matrix: 11 names are absent and six remain functions. Strict removal timing for the six retained wrappers should only change if current Blizzard UI no longer needs them.

### Practical next step

If the exact-behavior work resumes, create live PTR probe addons for restricted-unit returns, encounter payloads, SimulateMouse taint/focus restrictions, debug secret propagation, secure `raidtarget` actions, DurationTextBinding object semantics, and widget secret-aspect behavior.
