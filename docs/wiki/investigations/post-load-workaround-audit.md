# Post-Load Workaround Audit

The retail startup workaround audit separates duplicate per-addon patches from
temporary compatibility shims that still represent missing simulator state or
lifecycle behavior.

## Content

### Retired duplicates

These hooks previously ran from `src/loader/addon.rs` even though
`patch_runtime_surface_for_addon_load` already applies the same per-addon
surface:

| Addon | Retired loader hook | Remaining source of behavior |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `Blizzard_AccountStore` | `patch_account_store_set_storefront` | `patch_runtime_feature_addon_surfaces` for `Blizzard_AccountStore` |
| `Blizzard_MapCanvas` | `patch_map_canvas_scroll_container` | `patch_runtime_map_addon_surfaces` for `Blizzard_MapCanvas` |
| `Blizzard_FrameXMLUtil` | `patch_quest_objective_defaults` | `patch_runtime_core_addon_surfaces` for `Blizzard_FrameXMLUtil` |

The retirement criterion was exact duplicate call path, not visual symptom
masking. The remaining runtime hooks still isolate the temporary Lua surfaces in
`src/lua_api/workarounds/temporary/`.

### Remaining temporary hooks

These hooks are not duplicate call paths in the current loader. They stay as
temporary workarounds until the named simulator subsystem is modeled directly.

| Addon | Hook | Current rationale | Retirement path |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `Blizzard_EnvironmentCleanup` | `restore_post_cleanup_globals` | Blizzard cleanup nils globals that later addons still need in the simulator bootstrap; preserve-mode UI-string restoration fills only missing constants and strings, and guarded gamepad cursor defaults remain available for the real `ToggleGameMenu` → `CloseAllWindows` escape path, without overwriting Blizzard assignments. | Replace with a cleanup/global-publication model that matches Blizzard's preserved runtime surface. |
| `Blizzard_SharedXML` | `patch_callback_registry_defaults`, `patch_shared_xml_anim_mixins` | Partial addon loads and animation mixins need callback defaults and `SetPlaying` behavior before the simulator's callback/animation lifecycle fully matches retail. | Implement callback registry and animation group lifecycle semantics simulator-side. |
| `Blizzard_UIParent` | `patch_uiparent_managed_frame_mixin` | Managed-frame mixin methods expect UIParent-managed state that is not fully modeled. | Model UIParent managed-frame registration and layout semantics directly. |
| `Blizzard_GlueParent` | `patch_glueparent_uiparent_attributes` | GlueParent aliases UIParent in glue screens, losing attributes expected by shared UI code. | Model glue-screen parent aliases without clobbering UIParent-compatible attributes. |
| `Blizzard_SharedMapDataProviders` | `patch_unit_position_frame_mixin` | Map data-provider mixins need unit-position defaults against incomplete map/provider state. | Implement the map/provider backing state rather than repairing mixin methods after load. |
| `Blizzard_UIPanels_Game` | `patch_quest_log_mixin` | Quest log mixin defaults paper over missing quest model fields. | Replace with modeled quest-log state and objective defaults. |
| `Blizzard_ActionBar` | `patch_action_bar_button_event_fanout` | The real action-bar event frame fans events out to registered button frames; simulator does not model that setup path yet. | Model `ActionBarButtonEventsFrame` registration/fanout directly. |
| `Blizzard_PlayerSpells` | `patch_playerspells_onload_backfill` | PlayerSpells child frames can be used before Blizzard OnLoad initialized per-tab state. | Fix PlayerSpells load/lifecycle ordering so child frames initialize through Blizzard handlers. |
| `Blizzard_Dispatcher` | `patch_dispatcher_surface_for_addon_load` | Dispatcher bootstrap has a dedicated isolated surface and boundary tests. | Replace when the dispatcher model no longer needs Lua compatibility helpers. |
| `Blizzard_AchievementUI` | `patch_achievement_search_preview_for_addon_load` | Achievement search preview selection needs post-load wiring against current incomplete preview state. | Model the achievement search preview data/state directly. |

`restore_post_cleanup_globals` calls `restore_missing_ui_strings` after Blizzard cleanup. The preserve policy fills nil entries across the shared string, integer, float, and font-color tables; it restores required autocomplete priorities and combat-log raid-target constants while retaining Blizzard reassignment and table extensions. It also reapplies the guarded `CanAutoSetGamePadCursorControl` and `SetGamePadCursorControl` defaults, which GameMenu calls before the close-window stack. This is targeted runtime restoration, not generic global mirroring.

`chat_window_defaults.rs` remains a separate temporary compatibility surface: its existing `__wow_chat_window_state` table now stores chat-window names and docked flags for `SetChatWindowName()` / `SetChatWindowDocked()` and returns them through `GetChatWindowInfo()`. Retire this table when saved chat-layout state is modeled; no `SimState` persistence is claimed.

### Runtime-surface buckets

`patch_runtime_surface_for_addon_load` also runs broader buckets before the
loader's explicit match table. These are intentionally grouped by missing
runtime subsystem instead of by one visible addon symptom:

| Bucket | Examples | Current rationale | Retirement path |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Core bootstrap surfaces | SharedXMLBase pool constructor sync, chat/voice button surface, paged content page text, PlayerSpells/PvP talent defaults | Keeps foundational Blizzard helpers available in secure/addon load contexts where the simulator bootstrap does not yet mirror Blizzard's publication order. | Move each helper into the backing runtime system and delete the Lua compatibility function once startup still passes without it. |
| Journal/load-on-demand surfaces | Collections journal namespace, Encounter Journal toggle, Adventure Map surface | Demand-loaded panels expect globals and toggle helpers before the simulator has a complete panel/panel-manager model. | Model the journal/panel registration paths directly. |
| Feature panel surfaces | Artifact item quality colors, Auction House aliases/events, Auth Challenge parent repair, Catalog Shop defaults, Damage Meter scroll extent | Feature panels expose missing C/API or frame initialization surfaces during partial and full startup. | Replace with modeled C/API data and frame initialization instead of post-load patching. |
| Map surfaces | fog-of-war pin methods, map exploration pin methods, data-provider attachment, MapCanvas scroll-container methods | Map canvas providers need method and attachment repairs until map/provider frames are modeled at the same lifecycle points as retail. | Implement provider attachment and pin behavior in simulator state/layout code. |
