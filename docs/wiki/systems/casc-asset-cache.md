# CASC asset cache

The simulator reads textures and fonts from a live WoW install via three stacked caches. Each layer has a distinct purpose, lifetime, and on-disk location; this page explains what they cache, how they're wired together, and the measured cost of hits and misses.

## Cache layers

| Layer | Stores | Location | Built / refreshed by | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FDID resolution | `fdid → (content_key, encoding_key)` | `~/.cache/asset-resolver/casc/<product>/<build-key>/resolution.sqlite` (~85 MB, ~1.87 M rows) | `asset-resolver` on first miss or stale cache; `casc_refresh` can prewarm it | Persistent across processes; rebuilt when WoW patches |
| BLP byte cache | Extracted BLP files keyed by listfile path | `~/.cache/wow-ui-sim/casc-extract/<Interface/...>.blp` | `asset_resolver::ensure_cached` on first miss | Persistent across processes; never invalidated automatically |
| Blizzard UI source cache | Extracted Blizzard Lua/XML/TOC source files | `~/.cache/wow-ui-sim/blizzard-ui/<profile>/AddOns/<Blizzard_...>` | `wow-cli casc sync-blizzard-ui` or GUI startup when the cache is missing | Persistent across processes; guarded by `.wow-ui-sim-blizzard-ui-complete` |
| In-memory texture cache | `TextureData` (decoded RGBA) keyed by normalised wow path | `TextureManager::cache` | `TextureManager::load` on first hit | Per-process |

The resolution sqlite is generated cache data, not repo data. wow-ui-sim constructs `asset-resolver` with an explicit cache root: `$ASSET_RESOLVER_CACHE_DIR` when set, otherwise `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/asset-resolver` or `~/.cache/asset-resolver`. The path is product/build-key scoped so retail, classic, and future patch builds do not overwrite each other. Runtime loading no longer depends on `GAME_ENGINE_SHARED_ROOT` or a sibling game-engine checkout.

Without the resolution sqlite, first CASC use reads the local build config, extracts fresh `root.bin` and `encoding.bin` from the WoW install into the cache directory, and builds the sqlite. Warm starts become a single `Connection::open` plus per-FDID sqlite SELECTs.

## Lookup flow

```
TextureManager::load(wow_path)
  ├─ in-memory hit?         → return TextureData     [≈ 2 µs]
  ├─ resolve_path(normalised)
  │    ├─ addon dir?        → file path
  │    ├─ try_casc_resolve
  │    │    ├─ asset_resolver::lookup_path           (listfile, multiple ext candidates)
  │    │    ├─ out_path.exists()?                    [BLP cache hit → return path]
  │    │    └─ asset_resolver::ensure_cached(fdid)
  │    │         ├─ first call per process: init CASC
  │    │         │    ├─ Installation::open + initialize  (load 45 .idx + open .data archives)
  │    │         │    └─ open/rebuild resolution sqlite   (cache hit, or root/encoding refresh)
  │    │         ├─ resolve_fdid(fdid)               (sqlite SELECT → encoding key)
  │    │         ├─ read_file_by_encoding_key        (archive read + BLTE decompress)
  │    │         └─ write to out_path                (BLP cache populated)
  │    └─ extracted-Interface fallback under <wow>/_retail_/BlizzardInterfaceArt
  └─ load_texture_file(path) + insert in-memory cache
```

`Installation::initialize` does **not** parse `root.bin` or `encoding.bin` on warm starts — that work is delegated to the resolution sqlite. If the sqlite is missing or stale, `asset-resolver` rebuilds it once from the current local CASC build.

## Measured costs

Breakdown by layer:

- **CASC init** (one-time per process, first extract only): ~300 ms. Loads 45 `.idx` files, opens 190 GB of `.data` archives via mmap, opens the resolution sqlite. Independent of the asset being requested.
- **CASC per-file extract** (steady state): ~10 ms typical. Sqlite SELECT (sub-µs) + index lookup + archive read + BLTE decompress + disk write.
- **BLP cache hit** (file present, fresh `TextureManager`): ~1 ms. Listfile lookup + `out_path.exists()` + read + image-blp decode.
- **In-memory hit**: ~2 µs. HashMap lookup.

The BLP byte cache is roughly **10× faster** than re-extracting steady-state, and ~300× faster than the very first asset of the process. Once populated (`~/.cache/wow-ui-sim/casc-extract/`, currently 672 MB / 1747 files), the simulator can avoid CASC init entirely for any startup that touches only assets already on disk.

## Blizzard UI source cache

`data/blizzard-ui-files/<profile>.txt` manifests list the Blizzard UI source files for each supported profile. The retail manifest mirrors the complete Gethe `live` AddOns tree, including `Classic/` and `Mainline/` family variants; this preserves source inventory even though retail runtime `[Family]` substitution selects `Mainline`. `wow-cli casc sync-blizzard-ui` resolves each active-profile manifest entry as `Interface/AddOns/<entry>`, extracts it from the active CASC product into `~/.cache/wow-ui-sim/blizzard-ui/<profile>/AddOns`, and preserves Blizzard's original addon/file casing on disk. The bundled limited listfile is generated from the union of those profile manifests plus tracked `data/listfile-overrides.csv` rows for paths missing from the upstream community listfile or requiring canonical display casing.

Local install archives are tried first through `asset-resolver`. If the active product root/encoding metadata resolves an FDID but the local streaming install lacks that archive chunk, sync downloads the missing authoritative CASC blob from Blizzard's CDN by encoding key via the public `Osso/casc-extract` library. CDN archive indexes persist under `~/.cache/casc-extract/<product>-<build>/indices`.

The GUI startup path uses the cache only. If the completion marker is missing, startup syncs the manifest from CASC and rechecks the cache. The old `Interface/BlizzardUI` symlink and `vendor/wow-ui-source` checkout are not part of runtime discovery.

### Bundled limited listfile

`tools/gen_limited_listfile.py` stores ordinary community rows with normalized lowercase paths. `data/listfile-overrides.csv` is authoritative: an override replaces the source display path for both normalized path and FDID resolution while preserving slash-normalized canonical casing. Generated rows sort by normalized path, keeping output deterministic when display casing differs.

### Retail-only isolation test

Run `scripts/test-retail-casc-isolation.py` to verify the retail manifest without allowing access to any sibling WoW flavor. The script builds `wow-cli`, discovers every `_..._` directory beside `_retail_`, masks the non-retail directories with empty Bubblewrap mounts, and syncs into a fresh writable HOME/cache. Failed runs preserve the cache and `retail-casc-isolation.log`, then print manifest entries that are absent or fail profile-specific content validation.

```bash
./scripts/test-retail-casc-isolation.py
./scripts/test-retail-casc-isolation.py --skip-build --keep-cache
```

To add a genuinely required retail file:

1. Confirm the path is present in the Gethe `live` AddOns tree and referenced by a retail `_Mainline.toc` or its transitive dependency. Do not add a path merely because it appears in Classic, PTR, or another profile manifest.
2. Confirm the path or FDID exists in the active retail CASC product. A file absent from retail CASC is a stale manifest candidate, not a file to fabricate locally.
3. Add the addon-relative path to `data/blizzard-ui-files/retail.txt` using Blizzard's original casing.
4. If the community listfile does not map the path yet, add a verified `FDID;interface/addons/...` row to `data/listfile-overrides.csv`.
5. Regenerate the bundled subset with `python3 tools/gen_limited_listfile.py`.
6. Run the manifest mapping test and the retail-only isolation script again.

When removing an unavailable entry, first prove it is not reachable from the retail TOC/dependency graph. Extraction failure alone is insufficient because a valid retail file may require an updated FDID or listfile override.

## Failure modes

- **Resolution sqlite missing or stale**: `asset-resolver` logs the open failure, extracts current `root.bin` / `encoding.bin`, rebuilds `resolution.sqlite`, then reopens it. If rebuild fails, CASC lookup fails with the underlying read/build error.
- **Wrong cache override**: an invalid `$ASSET_RESOLVER_CACHE_DIR` can put generated CASC metadata in an unexpected place or one without write permission. Unset it to use `~/.cache/asset-resolver`.
- **Case-variant duplicates**: `out_path` uses the case returned by the listfile lookup. If a caller passes a non-canonical case to `lookup_path`, the BLP can land under `interface/...` or `INTERFACE/...` instead of `Interface/...`. The cache currently has 4 such stragglers out of 1747 files; harmless but wasteful.
- **Listfile/CASC drift**: when the live archives have GC'd a file the encoding manifest still references, CASC extract fails with "missing resolution entry" or "missing archive location". The loader writes a `.missing` sentinel and falls back to `<wow>/_retail_/BlizzardInterfaceArt/` for the next request.
- **Partial Blizzard UI source sync**: the source cache is ignored unless `.wow-ui-sim-blizzard-ui-complete` exists. Re-run `wow-cli casc sync-blizzard-ui` after fixing CASC/listfile issues. Missing Blizzard UI source files are not filled from repo mirrors; if local archives lack chunks that the active product metadata still references, sync may fetch those chunks from Blizzard CDN and cache the archive indexes under `~/.cache/casc-extract/`.
