# Texture Atlas System

Texture handling spans three interconnected layers: file I/O and caching (TextureManager), atlas name resolution and nine-slice detection (Atlas system), and GPU quad batching (rendering). The system supports BLP, PNG, WebP, and TGA formats, with WebP as the preferred local cache format.

## TextureManager (`src/texture.rs`)

```rust
pub struct TextureManager {
    addons_path: Option<PathBuf>,     // Addon directories
    cache: HashMap<String, TextureData>,
    sub_cache: HashMap<String, TextureData>,
}
```

All textures decoded to `TextureData { width, height, pixels: Vec<u8> }` in RGBA8.

**Path resolution priority**: addon textures (`Interface/AddOns/...`) → CASC via `asset-resolver` against the live WoW install at `/syncthing/World of Warcraft/Data`. Extracted BLPs are cached under `~/.cache/wow-ui-sim/casc-extract/`.

**Path normalization**: backslashes to forward slashes, extension stripped. `Interface\Buttons\UI-Panel-Button-Up.blp` → `Interface/Buttons/UI-Panel-Button-Up`. CASC lookup retries with several extensions (`blp`, `tga`, `ttf`, `otf`).

**Formats**: BLP via `image_blp` crate; the `casc` feature gates the CASC tier (default-on). Set `WOW_SIM_CASC=0` to disable.

## Atlas Lookup (`src/atlas.rs`)

The atlas database is a compiled perfect hash map (`phf_map!`) with ~50K entries built from WoW CSV exports at compile time.

```rust
pub struct AtlasInfo {
    pub file: &'static str,     // backing texture path
    pub width: u32, pub height: u32,
    pub left_tex_coord: f32, pub right_tex_coord: f32,
    pub top_tex_coord: f32, pub bottom_tex_coord: f32,
    pub tiles_horizontally: bool, pub tiles_vertically: bool,
}
```

`get_atlas_info(name)` resolution order:
1. Exact match (case-insensitive, strip/add `-2x` suffix)
2. Size-suffixed fallback: `coin-copper` → try `-16x16`, `-20x20`, `-32x32`, `-48x48`, `-64x64`
3. Underscore suffix: try `_2x` then `_1x`
4. Spelling corrections (e.g., Blizzard typo `divider` → `devider`)

`is_2x_fallback` halves reported dimensions: `width() = info.width / 2`.

## Nine-Slice Atlas Kits

Auto-detected by probing `{kit}-nineslice-cornertopleft`. If found, `get_nine_slice_atlas_info()` assembles 8 required pieces + optional center:

- Corners: `{kit}-nineslice-corner{topleft,topright,bottomleft,bottomright}`
- Edges: `_{kit}-nineslice-edge{top,bottom}`, `!{kit}-nineslice-edge{left,right}` (note prefix variations)
- Center: `{kit}-nineslice-center` (optional)

`SetAtlas()` prefers nine-slice kits over 2x fallbacks. Kit names stored in `frame.nine_slice_atlas` trigger `emit_nine_slice_atlas()` rendering (4 corners + tiled top/bottom edges + tiled left/right edges + optional center fill).

## Texture Coordinate System

WoW uses 8 UV values: `(tlx, tly, blx, bly, trx, try, brx, bry)`. Internally stored as `Option<(left, right, top, bottom)>` (packed form).

**SetTexCoord remapping**: when an atlas is active, user-supplied coords are remapped relative to the atlas sub-region:
```
result_left = atlas_left + user_left * (atlas_right - atlas_left)
```

## SetAtlas Lua API

`SetAtlas(atlasName, useAtlasSize, filterMode, resetTexCoords)` — looks up atlas info, detects nine-slice kit, sets `frame.nine_slice_atlas` or calls `apply_atlas_to_frame()` (sets texture path, UV coords, tiling hints). If `useAtlasSize`, sets frame width/height from atlas dimensions.

`SetAtlas("")` is a clear operation. This matters because ElvUI's `StripTextures()` calls `SetTexture(E.ClearTexture)` followed by `SetAtlas("")`; the generated atlas database contains an accidental empty-name entry pointing at a casting-bar flipbook, but the Lua API must treat the empty atlas name as clearing texture/atlas state rather than resolving that entry.

**Button texture propagation**: child textures with standard parentKeys (NormalTexture, PushedTexture, etc.) sync atlas info to the parent button's state fields. Custom parentKeys render independently.

When a standard button texture child is cleared with `SetAtlas("")`, the corresponding parent button slot is cleared too. Without that propagation, stripped Normal/Pushed/Highlight children can leave stale parent button texture fields behind for the render path.

## Deferred Texture Loading

Quad batch uses `push_textured_path()` with deferred loading: quads store a path reference; during `WowUiPrimitive::prepare()`, paths are resolved to GPU atlas bindings. Ordinary RGBA uploads use the five size tiers; eligible compressed assets may use the separate BC1 or BC3 atlas. Mask requests use the same lookup, so a BC-backed mask receives a valid compressed-atlas binding and UV remap instead of being discarded as unresolved.

The live renderer keeps its GPU atlas in the pipeline across frames. For related headless before/after images, `render_batches_to_images(&[&QuadBatch], ...)` preloads the union of all requests and renders through one persistent atlas context. Separate `render_to_image()` calls repack slots independently; with bilinear filtering, atlas-edge samples can differ even when an unchanged quad's geometry is identical.
